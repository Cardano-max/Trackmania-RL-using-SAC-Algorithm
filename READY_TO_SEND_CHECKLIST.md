Subject: TrackMania RL Test Task - Complete Implementation

Hi Henrique,

Thank you for your detailed feedback. I've completed the full implementation with all three requirements.

âœ… REQUIREMENT 1: Two-Container Architecture
- Environment container (port 8080) + Model container (port 8081)
- Fully modular and communicating via REST APIs

âœ… REQUIREMENT 2: Graphical Race Playback
- Complete demo interface with 3D racing and live RL metrics
- Production-ready for stakeholder presentations

âœ… REQUIREMENT 3: Agent Communication
- Verified working communication between containers
- Model sends actions, environment returns state with LIDAR sensors

VIDEO DEMONSTRATION: [INSERT YOUR VIDEO LINK HERE]

The video shows:
- Two-container architecture setup
- Starting both containers independently
- Live container communication
- Full graphical interface with 3 agents racing
- All RL metrics explained
- Docker deployment ready

All three requirements are fully implemented and tested.
Looking forward to your feedback!

Best regards,
Muhammad Ateeb Taseer
