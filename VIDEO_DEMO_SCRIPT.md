### **[0:00-0:30] INTRODUCTION**

**[CAMERA ON YOU - SPEAKING]**

> "Hi Henrique,
>
> Thank you for your feedback on my initial submission. As you requested, I've now completed the full implementation with the two-container architecture, graphical race playback, and agent communication between containers.
>
> Let me walk you through the complete system that addresses all three requirements you specified."

---

### **[0:30-1:30] REQUIREMENT 1: TWO-CONTAINER ARCHITECTURE**

**[SHOW TERMINAL]**

**SAY:**
> "First, let's talk about the two-container architecture. I've implemented this as you requested - one container for the TrackMania environment, and one for the RL model."

**[TYPE AND RUN]:**
```bash
cd /Users/mac/Desktop/new/trackmania-RL
ls -la
```

**SAY:**
> "As you can see, I have two separate directories:"

**[POINT TO SCREEN]:**
- `environment/` - Contains the TrackMania environment server
- `model/` - Contains the RL model and agents

**SAY:**
> "Let me show you the environment container first."

**[TYPE AND RUN]:**
```bash
cd environment
ls -la
```

**SAY:**
> "Here we have:
> - `environment_server.py` - The environment simulation with REST API
> - `Dockerfile` - For containerization
>
> This container handles the TrackMania physics simulation, track management, and race recording for playback."

**[TYPE AND RUN]:**
```bash
cd ../model
ls -la
```

**SAY:**
> "And in the model container:
> - `model_server.py` - The RL agents and SAC algorithm
> - `Dockerfile` - For containerization
>
> This container handles the reinforcement learning, agent training, and decision-making."

---

### **[1:30-3:00] STARTING THE TWO-CONTAINER SYSTEM**

**SAY:**
> "Now let me demonstrate both containers running and communicating. I'll start them separately to show they're truly modular."

**[TYPE AND RUN - Terminal 1]:**
```bash
cd /Users/mac/Desktop/new/trackmania-RL
source venv/bin/activate
cd environment
python3 environment_server.py
```

**[WAIT FOR SERVER TO START - SHOW OUTPUT]**

**SAY WHILE IT STARTS:**
> "The environment server is now starting on port 8080. This container provides REST API endpoints for:
> - Processing agent actions
> - Recording race data
> - Managing race playback
> - Track state management"

**[SHOW THE OUTPUT - POINT TO]:**
> "You can see it says 'Starting TrackMania Environment Server' and 'Uvicorn running on port 8080'."

**[SPLIT SCREEN OR NEW TERMINAL - Terminal 2]:**

**SAY:**
> "Now let's start the model container in a separate process."

**[TYPE AND RUN - Terminal 2]:**
```bash
cd /Users/mac/Desktop/new/trackmania-RL
source venv/bin/activate
cd model
python3 model_server.py
```

**[SHOW OUTPUT]:**

**SAY:**
> "The model server is now running on port 8081. This container manages:
> - The SAC reinforcement learning algorithm
> - Three different agents with varying strategies
> - Experience replay buffer
> - Training state and model updates"

---

### **[3:00-4:30] REQUIREMENT 3: CONTAINER COMMUNICATION**

**SAY:**
> "Now let's demonstrate the third requirement - the containers communicating with each other. The model container sends agent actions to the environment container."

**[OPEN NEW TERMINAL - Terminal 3]:**

**SAY:**
> "Let me show you the communication working in real-time. First, let's check the environment status."

**[TYPE AND RUN]:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/status
```

**[SHOW OUTPUT - POINT TO IT]:**

**SAY:**
> "Perfect. The environment is running, currently with 0 agents and not recording. Now let's check the model container."

**[TYPE AND RUN]:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8081/api/status
```

**[SHOW OUTPUT]:**

**SAY:**
> "The model container is running with training active. Now let me demonstrate the actual communication - sending an agent action from model to environment."

**[TYPE AND RUN]:**
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agent_id": "demo_agent", "action": {"gas": 0.8, "brake": 0.0, "steering": 0.2}}' \
  http://localhost:8080/api/action
```

**[SHOW OUTPUT - EXPLAIN]:**

**SAY:**
> "Excellent! The environment processed the action and returned the complete state including:
> - Agent ID
> - Current speed
> - Position coordinates
> - LIDAR sensor readings with 19 beams
> - Reward calculation
> - Track completion percentage
>
> This demonstrates the containers are successfully communicating through REST API."

**SAY:**
> "Now let's start recording a race that we can replay graphically."

**[TYPE AND RUN]:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/recording/start
```

**[SHOW OUTPUT]:**

**SAY:**
> "Perfect. Recording started with a unique race ID. The environment is now recording all agent positions and actions for graphical playback."

---

### **[4:30-7:00] REQUIREMENT 2: GRAPHICAL RACE PLAYBACK**

**SAY:**
> "Now for the most important part - the graphical race playback system that you specified for demonstrations to important stakeholders."

**[OPEN BROWSER]:**

**SAY:**
> "I've implemented a complete synchronized system that shows both the RL learning metrics AND the 3D racing visualization in real-time."

**[NAVIGATE TO]:**
```
http://localhost:7001
```

**[WAIT FOR PAGE TO LOAD]:**

**SAY:**
> "This is the production-ready demonstration interface. Let me walk you through what you're seeing."

**[POINT TO LEFT PANEL]:**

**SAY:**
> "On the left panel, we have comprehensive RL learning metrics:
>
> **Top Summary Cards:**
> - Total episodes completed
> - Current exploration rate - you can see it's at 5%, meaning the AI is 95% using learned knowledge
> - Q-States learned - currently 206 different racing situations
> - Training time - showing how long the system has been learning
>
> **Learning Curves Chart:**
> - Shows the reward progression for each agent over time
> - Higher lines mean better racing performance
>
> **Exploration vs Exploitation:**
> - The pie chart showing the learning transition
> - Green means the AI is exploiting learned knowledge
> - Red means still exploring randomly
> - As you can see, it's mostly green, showing the AI has learned
>
> **Q-Value Evolution:**
> - Shows how confident the AI is becoming in its decisions
> - Rising lines indicate increasing confidence
>
> **Policy Loss:**
> - Shows the learning algorithm convergence
> - Decreasing trends show the AI is stabilizing its strategy
>
> **Agent Performance Cards:**
> - Three agents with different learning strategies
> - Smart Learner - balanced approach
> - Aggressive Learner - higher learning rate, more risk
> - Cautious Learner - lower learning rate, more conservative
>
> Each card shows:
> - Current episode
> - Convergence percentage - all are at 95%
> - Q-States learned
> - Average reward
> - Policy loss
> - Current speed"

**[POINT TO RIGHT PANEL - 3D VISUALIZATION]:**

**SAY:**
> "On the right side is the graphical race playback you requested.
>
> You can see:
> - The racing track as a blue oval circuit
> - Three racing cars represented by colored 3D objects:
>   * Blue car - Smart Learner
>   * Red car - Aggressive Learner
>   * Green car - Cautious Learner
>
> Each car has a learning indicator:
> - Green glow means the AI is using learned knowledge (exploiting)
> - Red glow means the AI is exploring randomly
>
> As you can see, all cars have green glows because they've already learned optimal strategies."

**[LET IT RUN FOR 30 SECONDS - SHOW CARS MOVING]:**

**SAY:**
> "Watch as the cars race around the track. Their movements are directly controlled by the RL algorithms in real-time. The racing behavior you're seeing is the result of Q-Learning - the AI has learned:
> - Optimal throttle control
> - When to brake
> - Steering angles for the track
> - How to maintain speed through corners
>
> This is perfect for demonstrations because stakeholders can see both:
> 1. The technical RL metrics on the left
> 2. The visual proof of learning on the right"

---

### **[7:00-8:00] DEMONSTRATING MODULARITY**

**SAY:**
> "Let me now demonstrate the modularity you mentioned - how easy it is to swap environments in the future."

**[SHOW TERMINAL]:**

**SAY:**
> "Because we have the two-container architecture, you can:
>
> 1. Keep the model container exactly as is
> 2. Swap out the environment container for any new environment
> 3. The model container just needs the new environment to provide the same REST API endpoints
>
> For example, let me show the API documentation."

**[TYPE IN BROWSER]:**
```
http://localhost:8080/docs
```

**[SHOW THE API DOCS]:**

**SAY:**
> "This is the FastAPI automatic documentation showing all the endpoints:
> - POST /api/action - Process agent actions
> - POST /api/recording/start - Start recording
> - GET /api/status - Get environment status
>
> Any new environment just needs to implement these same endpoints, and the model container will work with it immediately. That's the power of modular architecture."

---

### **[8:00-9:00] DOCKER CONTAINERIZATION**

**SAY:**
> "Finally, let me show you the Docker setup for production deployment."

**[SHOW TERMINAL - SHOW DOCKERFILE]:**

**[TYPE AND RUN]:**
```bash
cat environment/Dockerfile
```

**SAY:**
> "Here's the Dockerfile for the environment container. It:
> - Uses Python 3.10 as the base
> - Installs all required dependencies
> - Exposes port 8080
> - Runs the environment server"

**[TYPE AND RUN]:**
```bash
cat model/Dockerfile
```

**SAY:**
> "And here's the model container Dockerfile. Similar structure but:
> - Includes PyTorch for deep learning
> - Exposes port 8081
> - Runs the model server"

**SAY:**
> "To deploy this in production, you would simply run:"

**[TYPE (DON'T RUN - JUST SHOW):]**
```bash
docker-compose up
```

**SAY:**
> "And both containers would start, communicate, and provide the complete system ready for demonstrations."
