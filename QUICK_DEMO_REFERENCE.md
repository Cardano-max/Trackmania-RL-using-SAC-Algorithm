## üìã **THE 3 KEY REQUIREMENTS**

### ‚úÖ **1. Two-Container Architecture**
- **Environment**: `environment/environment_server.py` (Port 8080)
- **Model**: `model/model_server.py` (Port 8081)
- **Show**: `ls -la environment/` and `ls -la model/`

### ‚úÖ **2. Graphical Race Playback**
- **URL**: http://localhost:7001
- **Show**: 3D cars racing + live RL metrics
- **Explain**: Perfect for stakeholder demonstrations

### ‚úÖ **3. Container Communication**
- **Test Command**:
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agent_id": "demo", "action": {"gas": 0.8, "brake": 0, "steering": 0.2}}' \
  http://localhost:8080/api/action
```
- **Show**: Model sends actions, environment returns state

## üí¨ **KEY TALKING POINTS**

### **Opening:**
"Thank you for your feedback. I've completed the two-container architecture with graphical race playback and agent communication."

### **Architecture:**
"Two separate containers - environment handles TrackMania simulation, model handles RL agents. Fully modular and swappable."

### **Communication:**
"Model sends agent actions to environment via REST API. Environment returns complete state with LIDAR, rewards, and position."

### **Visualization:**
"Real-time 3D racing with RL metrics. Perfect for stakeholder demonstrations. Shows both technical depth and visual proof of learning."

### **Modularity:**
"Because of the container architecture, you can swap the environment while keeping the model container unchanged. Just implement the same REST API."

### **Closing:**
"All three requirements met. Ready for production deployment and real TrackMania integration."

## üñ•Ô∏è **TERMINALS YOU'LL NEED**

### **Terminal 1 - Environment:**
```bash
cd /Users/mac/Desktop/new/trackmania-RL/environment
source ../venv/bin/activate
python3 environment_server.py
```

### **Terminal 2 - Model:**
```bash
cd /Users/mac/Desktop/new/trackmania-RL/model
source ../venv/bin/activate
python3 model_server.py
```

### **Terminal 3 - Commands:**
```bash
# Check environment
curl http://localhost:8080/api/status

# Check model
curl http://localhost:8081/api/status

# Test communication
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agent_id": "demo", "action": {"gas": 0.8, "brake": 0, "steering": 0.2}}' \
  http://localhost:8080/api/action

# Start recording
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/recording/start
```

## üåê **BROWSER TABS TO OPEN**

1. **Main Demo**: http://localhost:7001
2. **Environment API**: http://localhost:8080/docs
3. **Model API**: http://localhost:8081/docs

## üìä **METRICS TO POINT OUT**

When showing http://localhost:7001:

- **Top Cards**: Episodes, Exploration %, Q-States, Training Time
- **Exploration Pie**: Green = using learned knowledge
- **Agent Cards**: Different strategies, convergence at 95%
- **3D Cars**: Visual proof of learning, green indicators
- **Charts**: Rewards, Q-values, policy loss

## ‚úÖ **CONFIDENCE BOOSTERS**

**You have:**
- ‚úÖ Real Q-Learning (not fake simulation)
- ‚úÖ Real container architecture (not monolithic)
- ‚úÖ Real API communication (verified with curl)
- ‚úÖ Real 3D visualization (live rendering)
- ‚úÖ Production-ready code (Docker, FastAPI, proper structure)

**You understand:**
- ‚úÖ How Q-Learning works
- ‚úÖ Why two containers are needed
- ‚úÖ How REST APIs enable modularity
- ‚úÖ How to deploy with Docker
- ‚úÖ How to explain technical decisions

## üéØ **IF HENRIQUE ASKS...**

**"Can you explain the RL algorithm?"**
‚Üí "Q-Learning with epsilon-greedy exploration. State includes LIDAR, speed, position. Actions are gas, brake, steering. Rewards based on progress, speed efficiency, and racing line."

**"How does communication work?"**
‚Üí "REST API over HTTP. Model container POSTs actions to environment container. Environment processes physics and returns state JSON with LIDAR observations, rewards, and position."

**"How do I swap environments?"**
‚Üí "Keep model container unchanged. New environment just needs to implement the same REST API endpoints: /api/action, /api/status, /api/recording. FastAPI makes this straightforward."

**"Is this production-ready?"**
‚Üí "Yes. Docker containers, proper error handling, REST APIs, logging, data persistence. Ready for real TrackMania integration or cloud deployment."
