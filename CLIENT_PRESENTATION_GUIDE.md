## 🎥 Client Presentation Script

### Opening (30 seconds)
*"Traditional racing AI uses hardcoded rules. Our system learns optimal racing strategies through trial and error, just like human drivers. Let me show you live learning in action."*

### Live Demo (5 minutes)

#### Step 1: Start Training
- Open **http://localhost:4000**
- Click **"🚀 Start Training"**
- Point out: *"3 AI agents starting with zero knowledge"*

#### Step 2: Show Learning Metrics (2 minutes)
- **Learning Curves**: *"Watch performance improve in real-time"*
- **Exploration Rate**: *"AI starts exploring randomly, then uses learned knowledge"*
- **Q-Values**: *"The AI builds a knowledge base of racing situations"*

#### Step 3: Performance Analysis (2 minutes)
- **Agent Comparison**: *"Different learning strategies competing"*
- **Real-time Insights**: *"AI-generated analysis of what's being learned"*
- **Track Visualization**: *"See agents learn optimal racing lines"*

#### Step 4: Business Value (1 minute)
