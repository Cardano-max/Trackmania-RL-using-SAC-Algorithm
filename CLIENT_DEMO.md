## 🎥 Presentation Flow

### Part 1: The Problem (2 minutes)
"Traditional racing AI uses pre-programmed rules. Our RL approach learns optimal racing through trial and error, just like human drivers."

### Part 2: Live Demo (5 minutes)
1. Open **http://localhost:4000**
2. Click "🚀 Start Training"
3. Show **real-time learning curves**
4. Explain **exploration vs exploitation**
5. Point out **performance improvements**

### Part 3: Technical Deep Dive (3 minutes)
1. Show **Q-value updates**
2. Explain **state discretization**
3. Highlight **different learning strategies**
4. Discuss **scalability to real TrackMania**

## 💼 Business Value Points

### 🎯 **Immediate Benefits**
- ✅ **Self-improving AI** that gets better over time

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If demos don't work:
1. Check if ports are free: `lsof -i :4000,3000,8080`
2. Restart with: `./restart_demo.sh`
3. Check logs: `./check_logs.sh`

## 📞 Demo Support

For live presentation support:
- All demos run locally on your machine
- No internet connection required
- Backup command-line demo always works
- Takes 2-3 minutes to show full learning cycle
