## 🚀 **QUICK START (RECOMMENDED)**

### **Option 1: Automatic (Easiest)**
```bash
cd /Users/mac/Desktop/new/trackmania-RL
./start_demo.sh
```

### **Option 2: Manual (For showing two-container architecture)**
Follow the commands in **VIDEO_DEMO_SCRIPT.md** section by section.

---

## 📋 **WHAT YOU'RE DEMONSTRATING**

### ✅ **Requirement 1: Two-Container Architecture**
- Environment container (port 8080) - TrackMania simulation
- Model container (port 8081) - RL agents
- Modular, swappable design

### ✅ **Requirement 2: Graphical Race Playback**
- Real-time 3D visualization at http://localhost:7001
- Perfect for stakeholder demonstrations
- Shows cars racing with live RL metrics

### ✅ **Requirement 3: Agent Communication**
- REST API between containers
- Model sends actions, environment returns state
- Verified working with curl commands

---

## 🎯 **YOUR 10-MINUTE VIDEO BREAKDOWN**

| Time | What to Show | Key Message |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| 0-1 min | Introduction | "I've completed all 3 requirements" |
| 1-3 min | Two containers | Show environment/ and model/ folders |
| 3-5 min | Communication | Run curl commands showing API |
| 5-7 min | Visualization | Open browser, show full demo |
| 7-9 min | Modularity | Explain Docker and API docs |
| 9-10 min | Summary | "All requirements met ✅" |

---

## 💡 **TIPS FOR SUCCESS**

### **Before Recording:**
1. ✅ Close all unnecessary programs
2. ✅ Clean up desktop if sharing screen
3. ✅ Practice once without recording
4. ✅ Have water ready
5. ✅ Be confident - you built something impressive!

### **During Recording:**
1. 🎤 Speak clearly and at a good pace
2. 🖱️ Use mouse to point at important things
3. ⏸️ Pause briefly between sections
4. 😊 Smile when appropriate
5. 💪 Show confidence in your work

### **What to Emphasize:**
- ✅ "Real Q-Learning, not fake simulation"
- ✅ "Production-ready architecture"
- ✅ "Modular design for easy environment swapping"
- ✅ "Professional visualization for stakeholders"
- ✅ "All three requirements fully implemented"
